# DraftBoard
Fantasy Football Draft Board 

## Notes:
Update 8/13/21: Now using different dataset from FantasyPros included in the Data Cleaning IPython Notebook, includes projections made by FantasyPros rather than unique projections

Here's the NFL Database: https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb
The database isnt compatible with Python 3, so if we want to use this, we're going with 2.7.

## Goals: 
- Create ranking of players for 2021 fantasy football draft, sortable by position
- Turn into web app that can be used for 8/29/21 draft

## To Do:
- Finish cleaning data & updating with calculated metrics and values
- Create simple dashboard with sort, filter, and search functions (possibly with Dash app), including ability to cross players off list as they are drafted
