Fantasy Football Draft Board 
Edit this with notes and updates here

## Notes:
Here's the NFL Database: https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb
The database isnt compatible with Python 3, so if we want to use this, we're going with 2.7.

## Goals: 
- Create ranking of players for 2017 fantasy football draft, sortable by position

## To Do:
- Find/research main statistics to analyze for fantasy purposes (both ESPN and Yahoo)
- Clean up data from database into season totals for each of the main statistics for all players
- Decide on model for predicting statistics for players (PECOTA-style, etc)
- Apply model to statistics for each player
- Create rules for various leagues (Gordon's, Jeff's, standard, etc.)
- Transform predicted statistical values to fantasy point values
